# clojurescript-demo

My minimal foundation for a ClojureScript project on Linux/Mac.

## Dependencies

* Java
* Homebrew (Mac only; to install the Clojure CLI tools in the project dir)
* [Clojure Tools](https://clojure.org/releases/tools)
* Python 3 (optional; to start a simple webserver)

## Installation

### 1. Clone this repo
``` shell
git clone clojurescript-demo
```
### 2. cd into the project directory
``` shell
$ cd clojurescript-demo
```
### 3. Install the Clojure CLI tools, if you don't have them installed already.
I like to install the tools in the project directory, mostly because it makes it easier (for me) to keep them up to date.

``` shell
make install-clojure-tools
```

If you don't install the Clojure CLI tools this way, then you'll need to update the makefile to point to where your Clojure CLI tools are installed.

If you are on a Mac, and you don't have coreutils installed, you might need to do this first:
``` shell
brew install coreutils
```

## Config

* makefile
* deps.edn
* config

## Usage

The makefile provides several useful commands, which can be displayed by running `make` (without any arguments).

### Development

#### Workflow #1 (what I use)

Start a build process.

* Compile with dev settings.
* Start a REPL socket server.
* Recompile if `src` changes.

```
$ make dev-proc
```
Connect to the REPL socket server on port 5555.

In the REPL, which should be in the user ns, eval `(browser-repl)`.

Start a webserver.
```
$ make serve
```

Open a browser to localhost:9000.

Open browser console.

You should see "ClojureScript demo project started"

#### Workflow #2 (which may be easiest to get started)


Start a build process.

* Compile with dev settings.
* Start a REPL.
* Start a webserver.
* Open a browser tab to point to the webserver.
* Recompile if `src` changes.

```
make dev-repl
```
Open browser console.

You should see "ClojureScript demo project started"
