# clojurescript-demo

My absolutely minimal foundation for a ClojureScript project on Linux/Mac.

## Dependencies

* Java
* Homebrew (Mac only; to install the Clojure CLI tools in the project dir)
* [Clojure Tools](https://clojure.org/releases/tools)
* Python 3 (optional)

## Installation

### 1. Clone this repo
``` shell
git clone clojurescript-demo
```
### 2. cd into the project directory
``` shell
$ cd clojurescript-demo
```
### 3. Install the Clojure CLI tools, if you don't have them installed already.
I like to install the tools in the project directory, mostly because it makes it easier (for me) to keep them up to date.

``` shell
make install clojure-tools
```

If you don't install the Clojure CLI tools this way, then you'll need to update the makefile to point to the location where your Clojure CLI tools are installed.

If you are on a Mac, and you don't have coreutils installed, you might need to do this first:
``` shell
brew install coreutils
```

## Config

* makefile
* deps.edn
* config

## Usage

The included makefile provides several useful commands. Run `make` for a list of commands and descriptions.

### Development

#### Workflow #1 (what I use)

This command will:
* compile with dev settings
* start a REPL socket server
* start a webserver
* recompile if `src` changes

```
$ make dev-proc
```
Connect to the REPL socket server on port 5555.

In the REPL, which should be in the user ns, eval `(browser-repl)`.

Open a browser to localhost:9000.

Open browser console.

You should see "ClojureScript demo project started"

#### Workflow #2 (what might be easiest to get started)

This command will:
* compile with dev settings
* start a REPL
* start a webserver
* open a browser tab to point to the webserver
* recompile if `src` changes

```
make dev-repl
```
Open browser console.

You should see "ClojureScript demo project started"
